# jeep-detection

### Use Case
It is common practice for those driving jeep wranglers to wave at others driving the same vehicle. Driving my wrangler, I participate in this, but it is the 
absolute worst when I pass a jeep that waves at me and I forget to return the favor. My idea for this project is to use open CV to make jeep wrangler detector that
can let me know when a Jeeo is coming, so I can remember to wave. While I do not intend on integrating this into any sort of dashcam, that would be the theoretical 
future implementation.


### Current state
It is currently doing best at recognizing vehicles on the road which is good, as I would like to view a jeep coming down the street towards me. Next would be to find some images of an aproaching jeep and see if this standard xml file will work properly, in the future, it would be beneficial to add negative trainging to make sure it does not recogonize other vehicles as well<img width="497" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-08 at 2 31 44 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72896477/167312750-3429cc5c-4025-4248-af69-d3e2c6cd0f62.png">
