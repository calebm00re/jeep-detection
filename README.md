# jeep-detection

### Use Case
It is common practice for those driving jeep wranglers to wave at others driving the same vehicle. Driving my wrangler, I participate in this, but it is the 
absolute worst when I pass a jeep that waves at me and I forget to return the favor. My idea for this project is to use open CV to make jeep wrangler detector that
can let me know when a Jeeo is coming, so I can remember to wave. While I do not intend on integrating this into any sort of dashcam, that would be the theoretical 
future implementation.
